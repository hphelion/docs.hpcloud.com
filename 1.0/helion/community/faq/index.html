</ul><h4 id="whatcommunity">What is HP Helion OpenStack Community edition? And how does it tie into the overall HP Helion portfolio?</h4>

<p>HP Helion OpenStack Community edition is the first OpenStack distribution from HP. It is free to download and will be kept updated frequently to stay current with OpenStack developments. It will be a foundational technology for all HP Helion products in the future.</p>

<h4 id="distroenable">What does this distro enable customers to do?</h4>

<p>Customers have consistently asked us to release a distribution of OpenStack cloud, tested, hardened and supported by HP.</p>

<p>The final version of this free distribution will enable customers to evaluate HP Helion OpenStack and to deploy small-scale private clouds in production (up to 30 nodes). They will be able to do this more quickly and easily with HP's simplified installation and update mechanisms.</p>

<h4 id="howcompare">How does HP Helion OpenStack Community edition compare to other OpenStack cloud distributions on the market?</h4>

<p>HP Helion OpenStack Community edition is one of the first distributions in the market, based on up-to-date code from the OpenStack community. It is derived from pure OpenStack software and open source technologies, configured and packaged by HP. For example, TripleO, which is used for installation and update, is the official OpenStack project for deployment.</p>

<h4 id="distrocost">Is there a cost associated with this distribution?</h4>

<p>It is free to download. An optional support package is available to purchase from HP for access to HP Helion OpenStack technical support.</p>

<h4 id="TripleO">What is TripleO?</h4>

<p>OpenStack on OpenStack, or TripleO, is the OpenStack community's official project for deployment of OpenStack systems. It builds on the core resource-provisioning strengths of OpenStack technology. It enables you to administer your cloud, and deploy and maintain virtual and baremetal installations of the OpenStack platform using the same APIs you are familiar with for deploying workloads on an OpenStack cloud. A template-based deployment engine (using OpenStack Heat) allows for rigorous testing and reliable, repeatable deployments of known configurations.</p>

<p>A TripleO installation includes a seed, the undercloud, and the overcloud.</p>

<h4 id="preview">What is available in the current version?</h4>

<p>On May 7<sup>th</sup>, we announced a virtual preview of HP Helion OpenStack Community edition that allows our customers to deploy an OpenStack cloud-in-a-box on a single physical machine. Customers are able to experience TripleO based deployment and to evaluate the Icehouse release of OpenStack cloud.</p>

<p>On June 12<sup>th</sup>, we announced a GA version of HP Helion OpenStack Community edition with support for baremetal installation, allowing the creation of OpenStack systems spanning up to 30 physical servers.</p>

<p>On July 22nd, we announced a refresh of the GA version with several new features and bug fixes with the availability of Foundation Care Support Service for purchase.</p>

<p>HP Helion OpenStack Community edition will be updated frequently to keep pace with OpenStack platform  developments. We plan to release new versions roughly every six weeks, and to track the community development cycle.</p>

<h4 id="localized">Is the release localized for non-English speaking markets?</h4>

<p>No. The 2014 release is English only.</p>

<h4 id="hybridorpubliccloud">Will HP Helion OpenStack Community edition work with hybrid or public cloud projects?</h4>

<p>HP Helion OpenStack Community edition is API-compatible with HP Helion Public Cloud, allowing workloads developed on one to be deployed on the other.  Compatibility with other Public Clouds will depend on which OpenStack platform features they chose to support. It is tested and supported by HP for enterprise-grade, small-scale, private cloud deployments. Workloads are upgradeable to <a href="../index.html">HP Helion OpenStack</a>, with features and capabilities needed for the enterprise, government, and service provider markets, to be launched later this calendar year.</p>

<h4 id="nodes">How many nodes does it support?</h4>

<p>Up to 30 nodes in the final release.</p>

<h4 id="virtualmachines">How many virtual machines does it support?</h4>

<p>Up to 600, subject to the size of the VMs and the customer's hardware capacity.</p>

<h4 id="softwareupdate">How can customers update the software?</h4>

<p>HP will be providing an automated update mechanism.</p>

<h4 id="includeOS">Does it include an operating system (OS)?</h4>

<p>Yes. It includes an integrated LinuxÂ® host OS, hardened and tested for OpenStack cloud.</p>

<h4 id="upgrade">Is the HP Helion OpenStack Community edition upgradable?</h4>

<p>Yes. Customers who begin with HP Helion OpenStack Community edition can migrate to larger, enterprise-grade installations using full HP Helion OpenStack.</p>

<h4 id="nonhphardware">Can HP Helion OpenStack Community edition be run on non-HP hardware?</h4>

<p>Yes, provided the hardware meets the minimum specification. HP will be working with HP Helion Community edition users to develop a list of third-party hardware on which the distribution is known to run.</p>

####What is TripleO? #### {#TripleO}

OpenStack on OpenStack (or TripleO) is the OpenStack community's official deployment of the OpenStack project. It builds on the core resource-provisioning strengths of OpenStack technology to enable cloud administrators to deploy and maintain baremetal installations of OpenStack. Using the same APIs that they are familiar with for deploying workloads on an OpenStack cloud, template based deployment engine (OpenStack Heat) allows for rigorous testing and reliable, repeatable deployments of known configurations.

##Installing and Configuring the HP Helion OpenStack Community edition



###Getting Started 

####What are the prerequisites for installing and configuring the HP Helion OpenStack Community edition? #### {#prerequisites}

HP Helion OpenStack Community edition is installed using TripleO, which uses three linked installation phases to deploy a complete OpenStack cloud. 

**Hardware Requirements**

TripleO creates several large VMs as part of the demo deployment process, hence it is essential to use a system that meets the following hardware specification:

* At least 16GB of RAM
* 64 bit Linux machine with at least 16GB of memory to act as the host of the seed VM.
* At least 200GB of available disk space
* Virtualization support, enabled in the BIOS

**Software System Preparation**

1. The following packages must be installed:
$ sudo apt-get install -y libvirt-bin openvswitch-switch openvswitch-common pythonlibvirt
qemu-system-x86 qemu-kvm
2. If you've just installed the libvirt packages above, you will need to restart libvirt:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/libvirt-bin restart
3. Ensure that the root user has a public key. Login as root:
$ sudo su -<br>
    Check whether .ssh/id_rsa exists:
    $ ls~root/.ssh/id_rsa
If the key does not exist, create one, omitting a passphrase (just hit return):
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa 

####How do I install the HP Helion OpenStack Community edition, and what's included? #### {#HowdoIinstall}

1. Before you begin, remove the item re. creating a VM for the seed. This is done by the installer tool.
2. Login as root and unpack the tar file into root's home directory:
    $ sudo su -
    $ tar xvf <location-of-.tar.gz-file>

2. This will create and populate a tripleo/ directory within root's home directory.

3. Ensure that no LC_ variables are set:
$ env | grep ^LC_

4. If any variables are set, unset them using a blank export for each variable:
$ export <LC_VARIABLE_NAME>=

5. Start the seed VM:
$ HP_VM_MODE=y bash -x ~root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_start_seed.sh

The process of starting the seed will take 5-10 minutes, or possibly longer depending on the capabilities of your system. There is currently a substantial amount of script/debug output that will be disabled in the final
customer version.

Allow the process to continue; you may need to ignore a password prompt for a few minutes, then just hit return until the seed setup continues.

Once the seed has completed its setup processing, you can proceed to the second stage, which is to deploy and configure the undercloud and overcloud, and to start a test guest VM in the overcloud compute node.

$ ssh 192.0.2.1 bash -x ~root/tripleo/tripleo-incubator/scripts/hp_ced_installer.sh

####What are the minimum and maximum number of configurations allowed? #### {#minimumandmaximumconfigs}

The minimum configuration is seven physical servers:

* One VM for the seed 
* One undercloud server
* Three overcloud management servers
* Two Swift object servers
* One compute Server

The maximum supported configuration is 36 servers. 

####How do I install and set up the HP Helion OpenStack Community edition Admin Node? #### {#installandsetup}

It is recommended to install the Admin Node on a virtual machine only. 
Here are general guidelines for creating a virtual machine in an existing or new hypervisor infrastructure:

1. Configure the hypervisor host's network. The host must provide connectivity to the virtual machine Admin Node on an isolated private network 
to all the baremetal nodes' port eth0. And the virtual machine Admin Node must also have connectivity to a routable network for Internet access.

2. Create a virtual machine Admin Node with the suggested hardware configuration. The following configuration must be reviewed during this step:

    a. Ensure the virtual machine Admin Node's primary NIC is bridged or connected to the admin network and the second NIC is bridged or connected to a routable network for Internet access.

    b. For the disk configuration, the default Disk bus type/controller uses proprietary technology. Ensure you set that to the IDE/SCSI type.
 
    c. If your hypervisor is KVM, ensure the virt type is set to KVM.
 
3. Download the HP Cloud OS ISO to the host's local file system or data store.

4. Configure the virtual machine Admin Node to point to the ISO as a CD/DVD drive or install media ISO image.

####Should I reboot after installation? #### {#rebootafterinstallation} 

####How do I verify that the installation has succeeded? #### {verifyinstallsucceed}

<b><font color="red"> Raj:We will provide a simple means of running a set of tests to act as a health check </font></b>

## Setting up the seed VM 

####What is a seed? #### {#Whatisseed}

The seed machine is a single node that is effectively just an installer.  Its sole purpose is to create the undercloud, and that is all.  This is the equivalent of your workstation, laptop, or maybe staff-shell (if you ever used it).  It uses nova, glance and heat to install the undercloud.

This is not a full OpenStack installation; it is a cut-down installation providing only the software required in order to enable the installation of the undercloud onto physical systems in the data center.

####How do I create a VM for the Seed based on the CloudOS specifications? #### {#createVM} 

####How do I load a under cloud image into the seed VM? #### {#imageseedcloud} 

####How do I log into the seed VM and deploy the undercloud? #### {#deployUC}   

### Setting up the undercloud and overcloud

####What is an undercloud? #### {#Whatisundercloud}

The undercloud is what you use as an administer to maintain the hardware.  It installs physical machines using nova and the baremetal or ironic driver (in the same way that it was installed from the seed). It then uses heat to deploy and configure the resulting booted systems, which is analogous to the use of Chef in HP Public Cloud.  The sole purpose of the undercloud is to administer the physical machines in the data center for the purpose of making them run an OpenStack cloud.

This is not a full OpenStack installation, it is a cut-down installation providing only the software required in order to enable the installation of the overcloud onto physical systems in the data center.

####What is an overcloud? #### {#Whatisovercloud}

This is the HP Public Cloud.  This is the OpenStack installation that you will interact with in the same way you interact with the HP Public Cloud.  This is where the web interface will be housed, and the cloud in which all instances will be created/objects stored/volumes created etc.

This is a full and feature-rich OpenStack installation.

####How do I set up the disk configurations of the undercloud and overcloud servers? #### {#UCOCservers}

####How do I configure the physical network connecting the undercloud and overcloud servers? #### {#physicalnetwork}

####How do I install the overcloud? #### {#installOC}

####How do I verify the functionality of the overcloud? #### {#verifyOC}

####How do I deploy a software update to the overcloud? #### {#updateOC}

####How do I add a compute node to the overcloud? #### {#computenode}

###Understanding how to use the Dashboard UI 

####How do I launch the HP Helion OpenStack Community Dashboard? #### {#launchtheDashboard}

After you boot from the HP Cloud OS ISO, you are ready to launch the Operational Dashboard to set up the Admin Node.

To launch the Operational Dashboard:

1. Get the IP address of your main control plane node via <b><font color="red"><yet to be defined process></font></b>
2. Open a web browser pointing to the IP address.
3. Log in as the 'admin' user using the admin password provided via <b><font color="red"><yet to be defined process><
pre-defined login creds: I cannot comment at this point. The admin password MAY be hard-coded into 
images provided, or MAY be randomly generated during install.
Note - don't refer to &ldquo;ZIP&rdquo;  files. I doubt we'll use the zip format.<.font></b>
