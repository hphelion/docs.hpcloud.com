# HP Cloud Block Storage Overview

Need more storage for your HP Cloud Compute instances?  HP Block Storage is the way to go.

Once created, you can easily disconnect Block Storage volumes from one instance and attach them to another.  Snapshots can be taken to easily copy a volume before making significant changes to it.  Custom volumes ranging in sizes from 1 GB to 2 TB can be created using a variety of file system types.
