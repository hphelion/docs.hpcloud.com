# HP Cloud Services Extensions to Ruby Fog Binding

HP provides a native Ruby library through an HP Cloud developed extension to the Ruby Fog provider.  By using the HP Cloud Ruby library, developers can write applications using Ruby that interacts with the HP Cloud Services without having to deal with the underlying REST API or XML document formats.

This library is an extension of [Fog](http://github.com/fog/fog), a Ruby open-source cloud computing library. 

<!--Currently we are maintaining a running branch of the Fog library that contains all HP-specific support. Very soon, we intend to return our contributions to the primary open-source library.-->

The HP Cloud Ruby library currently supports HP Cloud Compute, HP Cloud Object Storage, HP Cloud CDN, and HP Cloud Block Storage. Support for other services will be added as they become available.
