# Glossary of HP Cloud Services Terms

Sometimes it's a little easy to become lost in the weeds of the cloud nomenclature; for such times, we've created this glossary to help you through.  While this glossary concentrates primarily on terms that are more specific to the HP Cloud environment, we have tried to include a salad of general cloud computing terms to help you along.  If you need additional definitions, we suggest going on over to the [Open Stack Glossary](http://cloudglossary.com/) and checking there.

For a quick search of the [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base), just click on the blue highlighted term!

###[Token](https://community.hpcloud.com/search/knowledge/Token) ### {#Token}
:    An arbitrary bit of text that is used to access resources. Each token has a scope which describes which resources are accessible with it.  While the Identity Service supports token-based authentication in this release, the intention is for it to support additional protocols in the future.

## U ##

###[User](https://community.hpcloud.com/search/knowledge/User) ### {#User}
:    A digital representation of a person, system, or service who uses HP Cloud Services. The Identity Service will validate that incoming request are being made by the user who claims to be making the call. Users have a login and may be assigned tokens to access resources. Users can scope their authentication to a tenant which then limits where and how their tokens can be used to interact with services.
