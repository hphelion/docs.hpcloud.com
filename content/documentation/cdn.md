Using the HP Cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) service, content inside [HP Cloud Object Storage](/object-storage) can easily be cached on servers in metropolitan areas all over the world to speed client access to them by removing much of the network latency.  Once a container created with Object Storage has been enabled with the CDN service, all objects within that container are automatically distributed to servers on the worldwide Content Delivery Network.

For a step-by-step guide to enable CDN on the [management console](https://console.hpcloud.com), take a look at the [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base) article [Getting Started: Activating CDN for your Object Storage](https://community.hpcloud.com/article/getting-started-activating-cdn-your-object-storage).
