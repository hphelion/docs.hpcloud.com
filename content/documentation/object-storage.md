Leveraging [OpenStack Storage](http://openstack.org/projects/storage/), HP Cloud Object Storage provides a way to store and retrieve objects in a highly redundant cluster of publicly accessible physical machines hosted in HP data centers.  Key terms include:

* **Object** - The basic storage entity, most typically a file
* **Container** - A compartment for storing **Objects**

The best way to learn more is to start using it yourself over at the [Manage Console](https://console.hpcloud.com).  If you have any questions, try our [Forums](https://community.hpcloud.com) where you can learn from our own internal experts as well as other users in the HP Cloud Services community.
