# HP Cloud Services Web Site Overview

Welcome to the HP Cloud Services web site!  We don't know about you, but whenever we go to a new site we're always thinking, "Yeah, okay; where the heck *is* everything?"  That's the question this web page is designed to answer; it contains an overview of the site as a whole, as well as some details on other web pages on the site where you can get the information you need.  So ride along with us now:

##Quicklinks
Rather than force you to read this whole page to find the info you need, here are a few links that maybe can help you out quickly:

* [Site Map](/sitemap): This is a full map of all the documentation web pages on the site.  Go here if your looking for information on something specific, such as Ruby Fog Bindings, the Identity Service API, and other similar topics.
* [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base): A collection of searchable information about HP Cloud Services. (This link is also in the navigation sidebar over on the right-hand side of every page.)
* [Forums](https://community.hpcloud.com/): Where users get together and discuss issues with each other and some members of the HP Cloud Services team. (This link is also in the navigation sidebar over on the right-hand side of every page.)
* [Console](https://console.hpcloud.com/): A link straight to the main HP Cloud Services console.  Click on it and go!
* [Release Notes](/release-notes): Release note information for the various components (Ruby Fog, Windows PowerShell CLI, and so on) of the HP Cloud Services.
* [Downloads](/downloads): A listing of all the downloads currently available for HP Cloud Services.
<!--* [Quick Start](/quickstart): Information to get you up to speed with the HP Cloud Services as quickly as possible.  It is best if you use the Quick Start in conjunction with the "Getting Started" video on the documentation main page.
* [FAQ](/faq): A list of frequently asked questions about the HP Cloud Services, and our best answers.-->

##Site Navigation
You may have already noticed that the site has multiple methods for navigating; we've included these so that you can choose the method that works best for you:

* The [Site Map](/sitemap) itself, as mentioned above, contains a full map of all the documentation pages on the web site.
* Next to the HP Clouds logo at the top of the page, there are three navigation pull-down menus and two quick links:
    - [**Products**](https://www.hpcloud.com/): Links to all the HP Cloud Services products ([Compute](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/cloud-compute), [Object Storage](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/object-storage), [CDN](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/CDN), [Block Storage](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/block-storage), [Relational Database](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/RDB), [Identity Service](https://www.hpcloud.com/content/hp-cloud-identity-service))
    - [**Documentation**](https://docs.hpcloud.com/): This here stuff you're currently reading; all the documentation available for the HP Cloud software ([Compute](/compute), [Object Storage](/object-storage), [CDN](/cdn), [Block Storage](/block-storage), [Identity Service](/identity), [API](/api), [CLI](/cli), [Bindings](/bindings))
    - [**Community**](https://community.hpcloud.com/):  Links to HP Cloud Services community resources ([Forum](https://community.hpcloud.com/forum), [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base), [System Status](https://community.hpcloud.com/status))
    - [**Blog**](http://h30529.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Scaling-the-Cloud-Blog/bg-p/cloudBlog):  A link to our blog, where you can read contributions from a number of different members of the HP Cloud team
    - [**Console**](https://console.hpcloud.com/):  A link directly to the management console, so you can quickly access the HP Cloud Services utilities
* On the right-hand side, you'll see a navigation panel that remains constant from page to page.  This panel contains links to the the places we think you'll want to access most often:  the Site Map, the Knowledge Base, and the Forums.
* Also on the right-hand side, when you are on certain pages lower in the documentation hierarchy, a second navigation bar appears to provide you with quick access different levels in that particular hierarchy.  For example, when you surf to Bindings page, you can see a secondary navigation box that contains links to Overview page, and the two subordinate bindings pages on Ruby Fog and jclouds. Whatever page you are on is highlighted, to help you keep your place in the hierarchy.

##Where to Start
"Okay", you're thinking to yourself, "That's a lot of stuff; where do I start?"  

* For beginners, we recommend the [Getting Started with HP Cloud Services](https://docs.hpcloud.com/) page, particularly the introductory video
<!--alternately, send them to the text version of the Getting Started page--when you get a chance to write it, that is!-->
<!--* For folks with a bit more experience, our Quick Start page is probably the right place for you-->
* If you're already well versed in the cloud, feel free to just go straight to the [console](https://console.hpcloud.com/) and get going

So there you have it; a quick overview of what's available to you.  If you have any comments or questions, please get in touch with us via the forums.  Enjoy!
