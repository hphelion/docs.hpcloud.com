# HPCS Activity Stream

Your Cloud experience can have a lot of moving parts!  Keeping track of various data about the resources you’re consuming, their performance, availability and a whole host of other attributes has to be a priority. This is especially true if you work in a group or a large enterprise - you need to track who has access or took what actions. With your knowledge or not, there is a vast amount of data constantly being generated from your Cloud resources. 

We believe that helping HP Cloud users consume and organize aggregated cloud events is crucial to enable the management of cloud resources.  Today, many software applications have adopted the **Activity Stream**.  The vast amount of data produced by many modern applications such as Twitter and Facebook have helped drive the utilization of this pattern to efficiently display information in a manner that is relevant and contextual to end users.

We believe that helping HP Cloud users consume aggregated event data is critical for our user community to enable them better and more efficient management of cloud resources.  We also believe in providing this capability in a *Unified*, *Consistent*, *Simple*, *Personal* and *Transparent* way.

This initial version of the **Activity Stream** should be considered a prototype, and will display Platform Alerts that our team will generate by hand. However, over time, we plan to add more and more automated event types to the **Activity Stream**. Some features for the future:

- **Platform Status Events** allow HPCS to let you know about upcoming platform upgrades, changes and other non-critical information of interest to you.
- **Targeted Messaging Events** within a domain allow you to send messages to all users within your organization (domain), just to those users in a specific group (tenant), or just to a specific user. For example, if you have groups within your organization like Data Warehousing, Analytics, or Quality Assurance, you can send targeted messages only to the group(s) you choose. 
- **Bidirectional Messaging Events** allow a faster communication alternative to email allowing us to be even more responsive to your needs. 
- **Provisioning Events** display the status of your provisioning requests so you have a clear, near real-time perspective on where each new node stands in the provisioning process.
- **Monitoring Events** give you deep insight into each of the nodes under your supervision and shows stops, starts, restarts, etc. without having to access the nodes themselves – all right from within the Management Console.
- Events have **Embedded Actions** that provide the ability to initiate an action (reboot, provision, snapshot etc.) right from within a message, making the management of your nodes even simpler and more straightforward.

Stay tuned – this first prototype is just a hint of what’s to come!
