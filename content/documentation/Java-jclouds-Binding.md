# Java jclouds Binding

Java access to HP Cloud Compute and HP Cloud Objects is accomplished using the [jclouds multi-cloud library](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds).  This easy to use library abstracts common cloud functionality into a simple interface.  HP has contributed a provider for both HP Cloud Compute and HP Cloud Objects back to the jclouds community to make our services accessible to Java programmers.

To get started, take a look at the [HP Cloud Quick Start](http://http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/wiki/QuickStartOpenStack), which walks you through the installation process and some sample code.

For more elaborate examples, take a look at the [jclouds-examples repository over at GitHub](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds-examples).
