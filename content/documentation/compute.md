**Note**: For security purposes, when you create a server, it is automatically assigned a floating, non-removable IP address.

Leveraging [OpenStack Compute](http://openstack.org/projects/compute/), HP Cloud Compute provides a way to instantiate virtual servers on publicly accessible physical machines hosted in HP data centers.  Key terms include:

* **Flavor** - A unique combination of disk space, memory capacity, and CPU
* **Image** - A collection of files used as a base installation, typically an operating system such as Ubuntu 10.10 or something similar.
* **Server** - An instance created out of a **Flavor** + an **Image**

A variety of Flavors and Images are provided by HP Cloud Compute that can be used to create a wide mix of Servers.  The best way to learn more is to start using it yourself over at the [Manage Console](https://console.hpcloud.com).  If you have any questions, try our [Forums](https://community.hpcloud.com) where you can learn from our own internal experts as well as other users in the HP Cloud Services community.
