# Windows CLI: Working with Meta-Data

When required, you have the ability to store user defined meta-data along with the objects placed within a Container. This is accomplished with the  set-metadata cmdlet. Input values for this parameter are a series of one to many key value pairs. Each Key Value pair must be enclosed in quotes and separated by the Pipe (|) character. Individual Key Values Pairs are delimited by a comma. For example..

<img src="media/Metadata.png" width="580" height="189" alt="" />

In addition, you can also see how one would view meta-data on an existing object with the Get-MetaData command.
