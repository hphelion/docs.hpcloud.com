Overview*Brief introduction and overview of the service and its intended use.*### 1.1 API Maturity Level*State the maturity level in which the API is in currently, based on the pre-defined stages i.e. Experimental (early Alpha, available internally only), Exploratory (Private-beta ready), Public (Public-beta ready), GA (Release to General Availability, SLAs defined.  The versions schema, status field, supports an enumeration of ALPHA, BETA, CURRENT and DEPRECATED. The versions->status field should correspond to the Maturity Level for the API, i.e. ALPHA for Experimental, BETA for Exploratory, CURRENT for Public and GA, DEPRECATED for all other versions of the API that are not supported anymore.***Maturity Level**: *Experimental/Exploratory/Public/GA***Version API Status**: *ALPHA/BETA/CURRENT/DEPRECATED*## 2. Architecture View### 2.1 Overview*References to architectural details of the service.*### 2.2 Conceptual/Logical Architecture View*Describe the logical components of the system and their responsibilities*### 2.3 Infrastructure Architecture View*Describe how the API fits into the overall HPCS Infrastructure*### 2.4 Entity Relationship Diagram*Describe the relationships between the various entities (resources) involved in the API*## 3. Account-level View*Describe the relationship of the API with respect to the accounts, groups, tenants, regions, availability zones etc.*### 3.1 Accounts*Describe the structure of the user accounts, groups and tenants.

In future CS might support complex group hierarchies, enterprise account structures while there maybe a phased adoption by individual service APIs*### 3.2 Regions and Availability Zones*Describe the availability of the service API in different regions and availability zones. State plans for future expansion as well.***Region(s)**: region-a**Availability Zone(s)**: az-1, az-2, az-3 **Future Expansion**: region-b### 3.3 Service Catalog*Describe if the service API is exposed via the service catalog. Reference the fragment of the service catalog showing the structure.*The service is exposed in the service catalog, as shown in the following fragment:	{	   service catalog fragment here	}## 4.
